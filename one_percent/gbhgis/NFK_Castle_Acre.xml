<gazetteerText>CASTLE-ACRE, a village and a parish in FreebridgeLynn district, Norfolk. The village stands on the Peddar way and the river Nar, 3&#189; miles NW of Dunham r. station, and 4 N of Swaffham; and has a post office under Brandon, and fairs on 1 May and 5 Aug. Here are extensive remains of a castle and a priory, founded, in 1085, by the Earl of Warrenne. The castle occupies the site of previous works; covered an area of about 18 acres; and had an encircling embattled wall, 7 feet thick. The priory was a cell to Lewes; included an area of 29 acres; had a cruciform church 218 feet long, a chapter house 40 feet by 20, and a refectory 110 feet by 26; and was given, at the dissolution, to the Duke of Norfolk. Part of the south-west tower, some pillars of the nave, the walls of the transepts, the chapter house, the refectory, the prior&apos;s lodge, and the gatehouse are still standing; exhibit features from Norman to perpendicular; and look very picturesque.&#151;The parish comprises 3,249 acres. Real property, &#163;5,427. Pop., 1,405. Houses, 334. The property is much subdivided. The living is a vicarage in the diocese of Norwich. Value, not reported. Patron, the Earl of Leicester. The church is ancient, large, and good; has a lofty square tower; and contains an ancient font and some curious monuments. There are chapels for Baptists, Wesleyans, and Primitive Methodists, and a national school. (In 1870-72, John Marius Wilson&apos;s Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales)</gazetteerText>
