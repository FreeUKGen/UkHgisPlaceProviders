Market-day, Saturday. Llandovery derives its name from a corruption of Llan-ym-Ddyfri, &quot;the church among the waters;&quot; is an ancient place, and at the conquest of Wales had a castle, a few remains of which still exist. The town received its charter from Richard III. in 1484. The churches of Llandingat and Llanfair-ar-y-Bryn are here. A Welsh collegiate institution was founded at Llandovery in 1847. The trade of the town is almost exclusively in mining. In addition to the weekly market there is a great market on the second Saturday of each month; several fairs for cattle and horses are held annually.
