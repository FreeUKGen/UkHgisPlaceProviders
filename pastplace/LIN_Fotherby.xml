<gazetteerText>FOTHERBY, a parish in Louth district, Lincoln; near the East Lincoln railway, 3 miles N by W of Louth. It has a post office under Louth, and a side station, of the name of Fotherby-Gatehouse, on the railway. Acres, 1, 400. Real property, &#163;2, 342. Pop., 267. Houses, 62. The property is subdivided. The living is a vicarage in the diocese of Lincoln. Valne, &#163;150. Patron, the Lord Chancellor. The church originally was of the 13th century, and consisted of nave, north aisle, and chancel, with western tower and south porch; but it underwent changes denuding it of the aisle, raising a pent-house on the tower, and rendering the rest of averagely late perpendicular English; and it eventually passed into so decayed a state that a resolution was taken, in 1861, to rebuild it entire, and on the original model. The new church was opened in 1864. There are Wesleyan, P. Methodist, and Free Methodist chapels. (In 1870-72, John Marius Wilson&apos;s Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales)</gazetteerText>
