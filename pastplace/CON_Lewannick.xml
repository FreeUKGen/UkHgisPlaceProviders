The parish comprises 4,000 acres. Real property, &#163;4,325. Pop. in 1851, 747; in 1861,685. Houses, 138. The decrease of pop. arose from the stoppage of mining, and from emigration. The property is much subdivided. Trelaske House is the seat of the Archers. Good building-stone, a very hard slate stone, and a fine vari-coloured freestone, for mantelpieces and ornamental work, are quarried. The living is a vicarage in the diocese of Exeter. Value, &#163;242. * Patron, the Lord Chancellor. The church is early English, not in good condition; has a lofty pinnacled tower; and contains monuments of the Lowers and the Archers. A chapel to Minster priory was formerly at Pollyfont. There are chapels for Independents, Baptists, and Bible Christians, and a national school.
