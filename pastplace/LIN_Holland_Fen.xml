<gazetteerText>HOLLAND-FEN, a fen and a chapelry in Boston district, Lincoln. The fen lies averagely on the North Forty foot drain, near the Boston and Lincoln railway, 8 miles NW by W of Boston; comprises about 22, 000 acres; and is divided, in allotments, among eleven parishes, called the Holland-Fen towns. The reclamation of it was effected considerably in the time of Charles I.; was carried on afterwards to a state of profitable cultivation; and resulted in material benefit, not only to the parishes immediately interested in it, but to the town and port of Boston.&#151;The chapelry was constituted in 1812; has been said to include the entire fen, with upwards of 10, 000 inhabitants; has been said also to be a mere appendage of the curacy of Fosdyke, or of the rectory of Algarkirk; but is really a separate charge with a pop. of about 1, 223. Its church stands in the Fosdyke allotment, close to the North Forty-foot drain, 4 miles WNW of Langrick r. station, and 8 NW by W of Boston; but is 12 miles NNW of Fosdyke. Its post town is Boston. The living is a vicarage in the diocese of Lincoln. Value. &#163;150.* Patron, the Rev. B. Berridge. The church was built in 1812. There is a national school.
