The property is subdivided. The living is a rectory, annexed to the rectory of Fugglestone, in the diocese of Salisbury. The old church had windows of decorated English, and a font of early English; and was restored by George Herbert, the poet. The present church was built in 1861; is in the transition style from first to second pointed; and consists of nave, aisles, chancel, and porch, with northeastern square tower, but presents a very irregular outline. George Herbert, who died in 1635; John Norris, the poet and metaphysician, who died in 1711; and Archdeacon Cox, the traveller and historian, who died in 1828, were rectors.
