<gazetteerText>BUTTINGTON, a parish in the district and county of Montgomery; on Offa&apos;s Dyke, the river Severn, and the Oswestry and Newtown railway, 2 miles NE of Welshpool. It has a station on the railway; and includes the townships of Cletterwood, Hope, and Trewern; and its Post Town is Welshpool. Acres, 5,099. Real property, &#163;6,106. Pop., 935. Houses, 173. The property is divided among a few. A sharp victory was obtained here, in 894, by the Saxons over the Danes; and nearly the last of the sanguinary struggles of the Welsh for national independence was made here. Several ancient entrenchments are on the hills; and a vast quantity of human bones was found, not many years ago, in digging for a foundation. The living is a vicarage in the diocese of St. Asaph. Value, &#163;127.* Patron, the Vicar of Welshpool. The church is early English, and good. (In 1870-72, John Marius Wilson&apos;s Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales)</gazetteerText>
