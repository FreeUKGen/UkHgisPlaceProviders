Real property, with King&apos;s Enham, &#163;3, 571. Pop., 159. Houses, 32. Six Roman roads intersect the parish; and recent researches have brought to light here, on land occupied by Mr.-Biggs, the walls of a Roman camp, the sites of more than one Roman villa of more than ordinary magnitude, coins of Antoninus and Constantine, and numerous fragments of tesser&#230;, Samian ware, vases, pottery, and tiles. Here perhaps and not at Farnham, East Sherborne, or Whitchurch, as antiquaries have variously supposed was the Roman town Indium or Vindomis. The living is a rectory in the diocese of Winchester. Value, &#163;208.* Patron, Queen&apos;s College, Oxford. The church is good. An endowed school has &#163;27; and other charities &#163;25.
