<gazetteerText>LADOCK, or Lassick, a parish, containing the village of Besock, in Truro district, Cornwall. The village stands on the river Ladock, in a fine valley, 2&#189; miles W by S of Grampound-Road r. station, and 7 NE of Truro; and has a post-office, of the name of Ladock, under Grampound-Road, and a cattle-fair on 13 May. The parish comprises 5,691 acres. Real property, &#163;4,320. Pop. in 1851,811; in 1861, 742. Houses, 169. The decrease of pop. arose partly from the closing of a large lead mine. The manor belonged formerly to the Pitts. Nansaugh is a chief residence. Large quantities of tin were long ago produced; iron ore, of superior quality, is sent hence to Swansea; and some comparatively large pieces of gold have been found. The parish is a meet for the Four Burrow hounds. The living is a rectory in the diocese of Exeter. Value, &#163;767.* Patron, Dr. Wise. The church stands on an eminence above Besock village; was recently restored, at a cost of &#163;2,000; and has a fine E stained window, and a beautifully proportioned tower. There are a Wesleyan chapel, and a slightly endowed national school. (In 1870-72, John Marius Wilson&apos;s Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales)</gazetteerText>
