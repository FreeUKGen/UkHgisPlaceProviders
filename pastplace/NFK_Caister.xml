<gazetteerText>CAISTOR-ST. EDMUNDS, a small village and a parish in Henstead district, Norfolk. The village stands on the river Tees, near the Eastern Union railway, 3 miles south of Norwich. The Venta-Icenorum of the Romans, their principal station in the country of the Iceni, was here; and Roman roads went hence to Brancaster, Cromer, Burgh-Castle, Dunwich, Bury, Cambridge, Colchester, and London. Substructions or traces of Roman buildings occur over an area of 30 acres; and Roman urns, bronzes, numerous coins, and other relics have been found. Ancient Norwich is believed to have been built of materials from the Roman structures here; and hence the old rhyme,- Caistor was a city when Norwich was none, And Norwich was built of Caistor stone. The parish comprises 1,044 acres; and its Post Town is Norwich. Real property, &#163;2,384. Pop., 162. Houses, 37. The property is divided among a few. Caistor Hall is the seat of Mrs. H. Dashwood. The living is a rectory, united with the sinecure rectory of Markshall, in the diocese of Norwich. Value, &#163;447.* Patron, Mrs. H. Dashwood. The church stands within the old Roman enclosure, and has a few Roman bricks in its masonry. Charities, &#163;42.

<gazetteerText>CAISTOR-NEXT-YARMOUTH, a village and a parish in Flegg district, Norfolk. The village stands on the coast, near the river Bure, 2&#189; miles N of Yarmouth; is supposed, by some antiquaries, to occupy the site of the Roman Garianonum; has a post office, of the name of Caistor, under Yarmouth; and is a coastguard station. The parish comprises 2,832 acres of land and 215 of water. Real property, &#163;7,290. Pop., 1,203. Houses, 298. The property is much subdivided. A strong moated castle was built, about a mile from the village, in the 15th century, by Sir John Fastolf, a native, the capturer of John II. of France, sometimes mistaken for the Falstaff of Shakspeare; and a lofty round tower and part of the north and west w alls are still standing. An ancient free chapel stood on the manor as early as the time of Edward I.; and was erected into a college for seven monks or priests, either by Sir John Fastolf or by one of his successors; and some remains of it exist near the castle ruins. The living is a rectory in the diocese of Norwich. Value, &#163;942. Patron, the Rev. G. W. Steward. The church is decorated and later English, and has a lofty square tower. There was formerly another church, with parochial jurisdiction, called St. Edmunds; but only a part of the tower remains. There are a chapel of ease, three Methodist chapels, a reading room, a national school, and charities &#163;97.
