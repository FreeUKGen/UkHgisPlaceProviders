The property is divided among a few. Roscoe says, &apos;&apos;the small village and tiny church of Llanwrthwl look out from the mountain-nest of wood and heather upon the broad river below, whose course runs through woods, only allowing occasional peeps of the opposite towering hills, also belted with avenues and groups of fine trees. &apos;&apos;Druidical stones are on Sevenstone Common, and in other places. The living is a vicarage in the diocese of St. David&apos;s. Value, &#163;85. Patron, the Bishop of St. David&apos;s. The church is dedicated to St. Wrthwl, and is tolerable. The churchyard contains a pillar-cross. There are an Independent chapel, and charities &#163;16. (In 1870-72, John Marius Wilson&apos;s Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales)</gazetteerText>
