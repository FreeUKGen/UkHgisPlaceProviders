<gazetteerText>NEOT (St.), a village and a parish in Liskeard district, Cornwall. The village stands on a head-stream of the river Fowey, 2&#188; miles N N W of Doublebois r. station, and 4&#190; N W by W of Liskeard; takes its name from a recluse, variously alleged to have been a poor shepherd or a brother of King Alfred, and figuring traditionally in very wild legends; and has a post-office under Liskeard, and fairs on the third Tuesday of April and 2 Nov. The parish comprises 13, 997 acres. Real property, &#163;6,052; of which &#163;50 are in quarries. Pop., 1, 584. Houses, 303. The property is divided among a few. The manor belongs to Major Grylls. More than half the surface is common and waste; and about 400 acres are woodland. he rocks are chiefly granite, greywacke, and slate; and they contain some veins of stream-tin. Dozmary is an intermittent tarn, lying 890 feet above sea-level, measuring about a mile in circuit, presentinga dismal appearance, and associated, in the popular mind, with some strange legends. The living is a vicarage in the diocese of Exeter. Value, &#163;466.* Patron, Major Grylls. The church is later English; has very interesting stained glass windows, and an exceedingly beautiful tower; and contains an ancient font, an ancient stone casket, and several brasses and monuments. The stained glass windows were constructed at different periods between 1400 and 1532; were beautifully restored in 1829, at the expense of the Rev. R. G. Grylls; present perfect and exquisite specimens of medi&#230;val art; and are fully described in a publication of Mr. Grylls, issued in 1854. A hermitage or monastery of St. Neotstood on or near the site of the church; and an arm of him was long kept in the stone casket still preserved in the church. An ancient chapel, dedicated to St. Luke, also was in the parish; and has left some vestiges. There are chapels for Wesleyans and Bible Christians, a national school, and charities &#163;37. John Anstis, the antiquary, was a native. (In 1870-72, John Marius Wilson&apos;s Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales)</gazetteerText>
