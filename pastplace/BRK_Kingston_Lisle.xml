<gazetteerText>KINGSTON-LISLE, a village and a chapelry in Sparsholt parish, Berks. The village stands near the Ridge-way, and near the Wilts and Berks canal, 2&#190; miles S W of Challow r. station, and 4&#189; W of Wantage; and has a post office under Wantage. The chapelry contains also the hamlet of Fawler. Acres, 2, 060. Real property, &#163;3, 186. Pop., 370. Houses, 73. The manor, with Kingston-Lisle House, belongs to E. M. Atkins, Esq. The Blowing stone, near the village, measures about 3&#189; feet in breadth, 2 in width, and 3 in height; is pierced, on each side, with holes; and, on being hastily blown into at any of the holes, emits a sound which can be heard at a distance of 6 miles. It is a kind of red sandstone; and is traditionally said to have formerly been used for giving alarm on the approach of an enemy. The living is a p. curacy, annexed to the vicarage of Sparsholt, in the diocese of Oxford. The church is old, has a small tower, and was restored in 1865.
