<gazetteerText>BARROW-UPON-HUMBER, a village and a parish in Glanford-Brigg district, Lincoln. The village stands 2&#189; miles E of Barton; and has a post office&#8225; under Ulceby. The parish includes also New Holland; lies on the Humber, nearly opposite Hull; has a ferry there, at Barrow-Haven, to Hull; and is traversed, along the coast, by the Barton branch railway, with a regular station at New Holland, and a roadside one at Barrow-Haven. Acres, 5,990; of which 1,370 are water. Real property, &#163;10,107. Pop., 2,443. Houses, 543. The property is much sub-divided. An ancient monastery, founded by Wulpher, king of Mercia, stood at a place called Al Barwe. An extensive entrenchment, called the Castle, and supposed to have been an ancient British camp, exists about a mile NW of the village. The living is a vicarage in the diocese of Lincoln. Value, &#163;260. Patron, the Lord Chancellor. The church is very good. An endowment for an afternoon preacher yields &#163;160 a year; and charities yield &#163;41. There are chapels for Independents, Wesleyans, and Primitive Methodists. (In 1870-72, John Marius Wilson&apos;s Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales)</gazetteerText>
