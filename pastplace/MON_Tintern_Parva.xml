<gazetteerText>TINTERN-ABBEY, a hamlet in Chapel-Hill parish, Monmouth; on the river Wye, 4 miles N of Chepstow r. station. It has a post-office&#8224; under Chepstow. A Cistertian abbey was founded here, in 1131, by Walter de Clare; did not begin to be used till 1268; was completed about 1290 by the Bigods; and went, at the dissolution, to the Somersets. The church measured 230 feet in length; and comprised a nave of six bays, a choir of four bays, and a transept of eight bays 160 feet long. The cloisters were on the N of the nave; the chapter-house stood on the E side of the cloisters; and the guesthouse stood in the orchard. The ruins of the church still stand in tolerable completeness; exhibit transitional early English architecture, in very fine character: have been admired by all observers as about the finest architectural specimen of their age; and are depicted, in glowing terms, by a profusion of famous writers, both prosaic and poetical. (In 1870-72, John Marius Wilson&apos;s Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales)</gazetteerText>
