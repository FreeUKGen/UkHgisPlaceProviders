<gazetteerText>Newcastle Emlyn (or Newcastle in Emlyn), small town, Kenarth par., Carmarthenshire, and Llandyfriog par., Cardiganshire, on both sides of river Teifi, 8&#189; miles W. of Llandyssil sta. and 26 miles NW. of Carmarthen, pop. 1753; P.O., T.O., 1 Bank; is an ancient place, and was at one period called Dinas Emlyn. It is said that the Romans had a fortress here, and that on its site was built the castle from which the town takes its name. The castle, which forms the chief object of interest, was held for the king during the Civil War, since which time it has fallen into decay. Newcastle Emlyn contains Adpar, one of the Cardigan District of Parl. Boroughs, which returned 1 member until 1885. (In 1887, John Bartholomew&apos;s Gazetteer of the British Isles)</gazetteerText>
