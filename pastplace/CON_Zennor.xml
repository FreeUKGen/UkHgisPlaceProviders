<gazetteerText>ZENNOR, a parish in Penzance district, Cornwall; on the coast, 4&#190; miles SW of St. Ives, and 6&#189; W by N of St. Ives-Road r. station. Post town, St. Ives, Cornwall. Acres, 4,229. Real property, &#163;2,964. Pop., 933. Houses, 166. The property is much subdivided. Gurnards-Head promontory is on the coast; descends precipitously into deep water; consists of slaty felspar, horn-blende, and greenstone; and seems to have been anciently fortified as a cliff-castle. Zennor cliffs extend nearly &#189; a mile in the vicinity of Gurnards-Head; are on the junction-line of slate and granite; and have a romantic aspect. Several baylets, one of them called Porth-Zennor Cove, alternate with small headlands. Tin is mined; and stone is largely quarried and exported. Barrows, a kistvaen, a cromlech, and part of a Druidical circle are on the moors. The living is a vicarage in the diocese of Exeter. Value, &#163;179. Patron, the Bishop of E. The church is good; and there are four dissenting chapels, a ruined chapel of ease, and national schools.
