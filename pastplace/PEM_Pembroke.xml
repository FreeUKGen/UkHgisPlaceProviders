<gazetteerText>Pembroke, parl. and mun. bor., market town, and co. town of Pembrokeshire, on navigable creek of Milford Haven, 9&#189; miles W. of Tenby and 2&#189;3 miles from London by rail - parl. bor., 6298 ac., pop. 16,339; mun. bor., 5626 ac., pop. 14,156; P.O., T.O., 2 Banks, 1 newspaper. Market-day, Saturday. The founding of the town is supposed to have been contemporaneous with the founding of the castle, with which is associated all the history of the district. Pembroke Castle is said to have been the birthplace of Henry VII. It resisted for a long time the assaults of Cromwell&apos;s forces. The ruins show walls of 14 ft. in thickness. The town has now but little trade beyond that connected with the Government Dockyard, which occupies 80 ac. of ground, and is strongly fortified. The inhabitants of the locality are chiefly tradespeople and dockyard workers. The Pembroke District of Parliamentary Boroughs until 1885 comprised Pembroke, Milford, Tenby, and Wiston; since 1885 it also comprises Haverfordwest, Fishguard, and Narberth; it returns 1 member.
