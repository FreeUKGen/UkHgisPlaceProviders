<gazetteerText>MANEA, or MANEY, a village and a chapelry in Coveney parish, Cambridge. The village stands near the Old Bedford river, and near the Peterborough, March, and Ely railway, 6&#189; miles SE of March; and has a station on the railway, and a post office under March. The chapelry comprises 4,768 acres. Real property, &#163;9,6 54. Pop. in 1861,1,206. Houses, 260. The pop. underwent much increase before 1867. The property is subdivided. The manor belongs to Lord Rokeby. An incipient strong building stood on a hillock, designated Charlemont, and was the nucleus of an intended palace, founded by Charles I., but relinquished, in an incipient state, in consequence of his public troubles. Ancient urns, containing burnt bones, have been found. The living is a p. curacy, annexed to the rectory of Coveney, in the diocese of Ely. The church is a brick structure, recently in very dilapidated condition; and a new church, on a better site, was contemplated in 186 7. There are chapels for Baptists and Methodists, and an endowed national school. Conyers Middleton was in cumbent..
