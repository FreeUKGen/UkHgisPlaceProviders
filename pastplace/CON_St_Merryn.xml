<gazetteerText>MERRYN (ST.), a parish in St. Columb district, Cornwall; on the coast, 2 miles WSW of Padstow, and 15 WNW of Bodmin-Road r. station.

The property is subdivided. Harlyn was, till recently, the seat of the Peter family, and commands a splendid seaview. The surface is exceedingly diversified; and the coast is lined by high rugged cliffs. The rocks are crystalline and schistose, and include veins of lead and antimony. Roofing slate is quarried; and a dark-coloured trap, almost equal to marble, is worked. A small quay, constructed in 1794, is under Catacluse cliff. The living is a vicarage in the diocese of Exeter. Value, &#163;257. Patron, the Bishop of Exeter. The church is ancient and pretty good; was partly rebuilt of Catacluse stone; and contains a curiously carved trap-rock font. There are chapels for Wesleyans and Bible Christians. A church formerly stood near Harlyn, and has left some remains.
