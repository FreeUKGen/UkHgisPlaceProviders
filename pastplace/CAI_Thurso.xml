<gazetteerText>Thurso.-- seaport, police burgh, and par., Caithness, on Thurso Bay, at the mouth of river Thurso, 20&#190; miles NW. of Wick by rail and 25 SW. of Stromness by sea - par., 28,049 ac., pop. 6217; burgh, pop. 4026; P.O., T.O., 5 Banks, 1 newspaper. Market-day, Friday. Thurso has a small harbour, which is obstructed by a bar at the mouth of the river, but there is a good pier and roadstead at Scrabster. Grain and flagstones for paving are exported. The fisheries in Dunnet Bay are productive. Thurso (from the Norse Thorsa - i.e. Thor&apos;s river) is an ancient place, and was a great centre of trade between Scotland and the Scandinavian countries. It was made a burgh of barony in 1633, and for nearly 2 centuries afterwards was practically the county town of Caithness. Thurso Castle is the seat of the Sinclairs of Thurso.
