The adjacent scenery, up the glen of the Edw, is highly picturesque. Prince Llewelyn was slain in the vicinity; and an excavation in the rock, about 6 feet square, still bears the name of Llewelyn&apos;s Cave. The living is a rectory, united with Llanvareth, in the diocese of St. David&apos;s. Value, &#163;355. Patron, the Bishop of St. David&apos;s. The church is an old edifice, in good condition, on an eminence a short way above the castle. T. Jones, the painter, who died in 1803, was a native.
