<gazetteerText>BATHFORD, a village and a parish in Bath district, Somerset. The village stands adjacent to the river Avon and to the Great Western railway, 2 miles E by N of Bathampton station, and 3e ENE of Bath; and it has a post office under Bath. The parish includes also the hamlets of Shockerwick and Warley. Acres, 1,820. Real property, &#163;5,329. Pop., 892. Houses, 186. The property is divided among a few. An old ford on the Avon at the village gave rise to the name Bathford; and an elegant viaduct, of one flat arch, takes across the railway a little below. Hampton cliffs, in the vicinity, are picturesque, and command remarkably fine views. Some interesting Roman remains have been found in the parish. Bathford House is a chief residence. The living is a vicarage in the diocese of Bath and Wells. Value, &#163;395.* Patrons, the Dean and Chapter of Bristol. The church is very good.
