<gazetteerText>ALKBOROUGH, or Aukborough, a parish in Glanford Brigg district, Lincoln; at the mouth of the river Trent, 5 miles S of Brough r. station, and 10&#189; W of Barton-upon-Humber. It has a post office under Brigg; and contains the hamlet of Walcot. Acres, 2,875; of which 335 are water. Real property, &#163;3,394. Pop., 497. Houses, 99. The property is divided between two. A high ground, with cliff, overhanging the Trent, commands a brilliant view of the basins of the Trent, the Ouse, and the Humber, and forms a strong, natural, military post for overawing great part of the coast of England. A Roman camp occurs here, of square outline, 300 feet each side, with vallum and ditch nearly entire; and now bears the name of Countess Close, from a tradition that it was inhabited by a Countess of Warwick. Alkborough is thought to have been the Roman Aquis. The living is a vicarage, united with the vicarage of Whitton, in the diocese of Lincoln. Value, &#163;209. Patrons, the Bishop of Lincoln and the Rev.Constable. The church is ancient. There are two Methodist chapels and a large alms-house.
