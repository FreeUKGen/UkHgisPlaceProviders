<gazetteerText>FISHTOFT, a parish in Boston district, Lincoln; between the river Witham and Boston deeps, and near the East Lincoln railway, 3 miles SE of Boston. It has a post office under Boston; and it includes a fen allotment. Acres, 6, 425; of which 1,845 are water. Real property, &#163;8, 020. Pop. of the fen allotment, 149. Houses, 31. Pop. of the entire parish, 586. Houses, 133. The property is much subdivided. An ancient manor-house of Lord Monteville, described by Leland, as &quot;goodly and great, &quot; stood here; but was all in when Leland wrote. A considerable creek once ran up, near the out-fall of the present Hobhole sluice, towards the church; and is supposed to have afforded great facilities for fishing, and to have given rise to the name Fishtoft. The living is a rectory in the diocese of Lincoln. Value, &#163;700.* Patron, W. Hopkinson, Esq. The church has traces of early English, but is mainly later English; was restored in 1856; and contains a chancel-screen of open work and an octagonal font. An endowed school has &#163;23; and other charities have &#163;66. (In 1870-72, John Marius Wilson&apos;s Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales)</gazetteerText>
