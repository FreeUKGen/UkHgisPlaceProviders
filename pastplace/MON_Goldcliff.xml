<gazetteerText>GOLDCLIFF, a parish in Newport district, Monmouth; on the coast of Bristol channel, 3 miles SSW of Llanwern r. station, and 4&#189; SE of Newport. Post town, Whitson, under Newport, Monmouth. Acres, 14, 262; of which 12, 065 are water. Real property, &#163;5, 144. Pop., 250. Houses, 55. The property is divided among a few. Most of the land is part of Caldicott Level, protected from the sea by embankments. A silicious limestone cliff, about 60 feet high, rising over a great bed of yellow mica, breaks the level at the shore, has a glittering appearance under sunshine, and gave rise to the name Goldcliff. A Benedictine priory was founded here, in 1113, by Robert de Chandos; and was given, at the dissolution, to Eton College; but has left no vestiges. The living is a vicarage in the diocese of Llandaff. Value, &#163;85. Patron, Eton College. The church is good. (In 1870-72, John Marius Wilson&apos;s Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales)</gazetteerText>
