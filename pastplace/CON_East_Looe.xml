Although the former prosperity of East Looe has fallen off to a large extent, the town does a considerable trade in the exportation of tin, copper, and lead; also pilchards, the fishing for which gives occupation to most of the inhabitants. The town has a good harbour and quay, and there are remains of a bridge built in the 14th century. East Looe was incorporated by Queen Elizabeth, and was separately represented in Parliament from her time till 1832. (In 1887, John Bartholomew&apos;s Gazetteer of the British Isles)</gazetteerText>
