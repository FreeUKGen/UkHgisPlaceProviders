A ruined castle here has been thought by some to be of Ph&#339;nician origin, and prodigiously old; but was really a structure of the 13th century, built after the model of the round tower of Pembroke Castle; and belonged to successively the Cliffords, the Giffords, the De Bohuns, the Staffords, the Crown, the Williamses, the Lewises, and the Davieses. The living is a vicarage in the diocese of St. David&apos;s. Value, &#163;174. Patron, W. D. Wilkins, Esq. The church has some Norman windows and a detached bell tower. Charities, &#163;7.
