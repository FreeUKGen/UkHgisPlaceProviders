Traces of a Saxon camp, called Craeg-y-Saesson, occur on the brow of a hill about a mile from the village; and traces of a British one, called Pen-y-Park-Newydd, occur about a mile further. The living is a vicarage in the diocese of Llandaff. Value, &#163;318. Patron, the Bishop of Llandaff. The church is an ancient structure, with an embattled tower. There are chapels for Independents and Baptists, and charities &#163;23. (In 1870-72, John Marius Wilson&apos;s Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales)</gazetteerText>
