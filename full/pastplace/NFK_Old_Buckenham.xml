A castle was built on it, soon after the Conquest; and gave place to the castle at New Buckenham. A priory of black canons was erected out of the materials of the castle; and given, in the time of Mary, to Sir Thomas Lovell. The living is a vicarage in the diocese of Norwich. Value, &#163;102. Patrons, the Inhabitants. The church belonged to the priory, and is plain and thatched. There are an endowed school and some charities.
