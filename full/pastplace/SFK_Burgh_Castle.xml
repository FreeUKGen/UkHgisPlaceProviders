A Roman camp is here, occupying fully 5&#189; acres, and showing features of strong construction with fine red bricks; and has been identified by many antiquaries, with the Rom an Garianonum. The living is a rectory in the diocese of Norwich. Value, &#163;400.* Patron, the Lord Chancellor. The church is ancient; was recently restored; has an embattled tower; includes fragments of Roman bricks; and is thought to have been built with materials from the Roman fort.
