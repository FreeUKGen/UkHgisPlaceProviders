The manor belonged, in the time of Henry II., to the Giffords; and passed to the Lamberts.

Arthur Fane. A pit in the neighbourhood of the grounds, called Chapel Hole, is popularly believed to have swallowed up a church. The living is a rectory in the diocese of Salisbury.

The church dates from the latter part of the 12th century; was restored in 1860, at a cost of upwards of &#163;2,000; and contains grand monuments of the Giffords, and several new memorial windows.
