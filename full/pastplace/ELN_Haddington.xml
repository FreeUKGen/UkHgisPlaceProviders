<gazetteerText>Haddington, royal and police burgh, par., and co. town of Haddingtonshire, on river Tyne, 18&#188; miles E. of Edinburgh, 44 NW. of Berwick on Tweed, and 388 NW. of London by rail -- par., 12,113 ac., pop. 5660; burgh and town, pop. (including Nungate), 4043; 4 Banks, 2 newspapers. Market-day, Friday. Haddington has one of the largest grain markets in Scotland. Among the chief buildings are the church, a Gothic edifice of the 12th or 13th century, -- it is surmounted by a square tower 90 ft. high, and its nave is used as the parish church; the Corn Exchange (1854); and the Knox Memorial Institute (1880), an educational foundation (with which the old grammar school is incorporated) in memory of John Knox (1505-1572), the Scottish Reformer, who was a native. Haddington gives the title of earl to the Hamiltons of Innerwick. The Haddington Burghs returned 1 member until 1885: they comprised Haddington, North Berwick, and Dunbar, in Haddingtonshire; Lauder, in Berwickshire: and Jedburgh, in Roxburghshire.
