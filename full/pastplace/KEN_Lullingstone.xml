<gazetteerText>LULLINGSTONE, a parish in Dartford district, Kent; on the river Darent, and on the Sevenoaks railway, at Eynesford r. station, 6 miles S of Dartford. Post town, Eynesford, under Dartford. Acres, 1,530. Real property, &#163;1,609. Pop., 63. Houses, 5. The manor belonged to the Peches; passed to the Harts and the Dykes; and, with Lullingstone Castle, belongs now to Sir Percival Hart Dyke, Bart. The old castle, sometimes called Shoreham Castle, was held by the Aldhams, under the Archbishops of Canterbury; stood on a spot now occupied by a farm-house; and has left some fragments. The present castle is partly ancient, but chiefly of the latter part of last century; stands near the church, in a valley between chalk hills; and is surrounded by a beautiful park of about 800 acres. The living is a rectory in the diocese of Canterbury. Value, &#163;350. Patron, Sir P. H. Dyke, Bart. The church is ancient; and contains a good oak chancel screen, some fragments of stained glass of the decorated period, and remarkably fine 16th century monuments of the Peche and Hart families.
