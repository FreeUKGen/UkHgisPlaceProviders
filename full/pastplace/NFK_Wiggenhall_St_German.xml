<gazetteerText>WIGGENHALL-ST. GERMANS, a parish and a village, in Downham district, Norfolk; on the river Ouse, 2&#189; miles NNW of Watlington r. station, and 4 SSW of Lynn. It has a post-office&#8225; under Lynn, and a wooden bridge over the Ouse. Acres, 1,219. Real property, &#163;3,648. Pop. in 1851, 750; in 1861, 633. Houses, 156. The decrease of pop. was caused by absence of labourers on the Eau-Brink drainage works. The property is much subdivided. All the four W. parishes are in Fitton manor; and much of the land is below the high-water level of the Ouse, and protected by strong embankments. The living is a vicarage in the diocese of Norwich. Value, &#163;160.* Patrons, the Dean and Chapter of N. The church is ancient; and there are three Methodist chapels.
